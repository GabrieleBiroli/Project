This week I deepened my research on the associated costs of the protocol. 
Which led to better study the implicit cost of a protocol in terms of slippage 
and divergence loss. Then I proceeded to better understand how is slippage control in 
Uniswap v3 an improvement of uniswap v2's slippage formula.

This week I researched new protocols and did a report on Bancor's protocol. In 
particular its advantages, like the benefit of using the native 
token in the protocol or single sided staking and Impermanent loss Insurance.
I also started to see how uniswap v3 can be implemented

This week I understood uniswapv3, implemented it.
Amine and I worked on improving it since it didn't perform well.
Then we started understanding more about Curve Protocl 
in order to implement it next week.
