Amine Roudani
- Developed test file with various tests for UniswapV3
- Developed a chart to represent divergent loss with respect to time.

Adithya Ravichandran
- Alongside Ludanyi Levente, completed the tokengraph code to graph curve for every protocol
- Refactored introductory window

Mathéo Le Masson
- Find bug : program crashes when user tries to withdraw while being unable to
- Started with Tu to create a graph showing the evolution of the wallet of each account (new GetMarketsbyAccounts function and Create new class AccountGraphItem)

Duc Nguyen
- Developing different strategies of Arbitrager
- Adding view method of the market in time steps

Mia Chambat
-This week I joined the Front End team to help them work on the dynamic styling of the introductory and main windows.
 I’ve become comfortable and familiar with style sheets/forms on c++, and am going to continue working on the visual appearance of our project next week as well.

Shubh Lashkery
- I further refined the simulation as a model that incorporates Black Swan events
- It also is backward looking, and derives expectations from the past
- I added a simulation function to the Playground class so it can be easily implemented in the Front-end

Kaoutar Fahraoui
- This week I implemented a perfect arbitrager function for the balancer pool. 
- Now, I am focusing on plotting the graphs of all the variables obtained in the First Simulation. 
- I am trying to figure out how to install Qcharts.

Gabriele Biroli
- This week I almost finished coding the arbitrager function for the ConstantSum simulation.
- I had some difficulty finding the equations for it, but once it was figured out I could quickly code most of the function. 
- I will now join kaoutar in plotting the graphs demonstrating the evolution of the system.
