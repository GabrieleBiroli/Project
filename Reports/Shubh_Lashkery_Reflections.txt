Shubh Lashkery - Head of Economics Research

Week 1:

This week I read a paper "SoK: Decentralized Exchanges 
(DEX) with Automated Market Maker (AMM) Protocols" 
(Xu, 2022), and understood the mechanisms through which 
Liquidity Pools operate. Furthermore we decided the 
structure and the framework through which we will operate.

The Econ research team will test how parameters effect 
different initiatives for stakeholders, and will hope 
to build a monte-carlo method simulation of the liquidity
pool to see how different values of parameters, effect 
market outcome. And how to conclude from this data. 

This will require research into how theoretical shifts 
in parameters are expected to behave, and what parameters
should be analysed. Then there will need to be code to 
run these simulations. And finally a dissection of the 
conclusions from the outcomes. 

This means there will need to understand how the market 
team's code works and how we can inherit their class, to
run our simulations smoothly.
