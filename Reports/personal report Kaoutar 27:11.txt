This week was all about trying to understand how a liquidity protocol works and how our work (as the econ research team) 
would be useful to the project. Moreover, I tried to get as many research papers as possible treating about automated market makers.
We came up to the conclusion that our work would mainly be to put in place a monte carlo market simultor that would test the liquidity
pool that is being coded. For this matter, two teams would be formed: one that would dive into research in order to understand the 
different inputs and expected outputs, as well as the specific functions, one other that would try to understand the codes written by 
the liquidity pool team. At the end, the goal is to test if the coded liquidity pool is a valid one. Mia and I are going to take care 
of understanding the liquidity pool codes in order to find all the inputs we should take into account in our monte carlo simulator.
