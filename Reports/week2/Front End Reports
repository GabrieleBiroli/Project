Jasmine Samson : 

- Implemented a pie chart representing the proportion of each token in a specific pool
- tested the implementation of the new widget using a random UniswapV2Pool pool (waiting for the implementation of pool environments by the Econ research team)
- next week I will try implementing new widgets to include in a Qt desktop app (we still need to figure out with all the teams of the project the format of our User interface)

Victoire Fabien:

This week, I started experimenting with different visualization tools I found. I focused on charts and familiarized myself with it. 
I was able to make line graphs and spline graphs which would then allow me to for example, represent the tokens in the pool. 
My task this week was to experiment with QtCharts in particular.
Next week, we will see with the front end team which tool works the best to represent what we want. 
I will then focus solely on that tool to start to visually represent our project.

Martina Paez Berru:

- Worked with the qcustom plot library (had some issues with the download).
- Worked on line graphs in order to represent the amount of tokens in the liquidity pool.
- I worked more with Qt's desgin and thought of the layout of the application (presentation) of the project.
