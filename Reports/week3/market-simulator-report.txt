Minh Pham: 
- Create wallet list widget GUI displaying tokens in account wallet.
- Documenting account API.

Alessandro:
- implemented base structure for Front-End branch: 
Created class template for visual graphs, and subclasses templates for the 2 types of graphs that we are going to use. 
The classes still need to be linked to direct implementations with QSplineSeries and other Qt libraries that could be useful. 
- implemented changes in the .pro file to get necessary requirements to run this branch using qmake


Tu Nguyen
- Completed: Add token section to the playground GUI, which enable users to create a new token with default price to be 0.
