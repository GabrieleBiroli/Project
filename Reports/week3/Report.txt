Shubh:

This week was spent really implementing instances of the 
classes which had already been written. I created the first 
test simulation with a simple for loop, and no added sophistication.
This simply kept track of the macro-objectives and is a 
baseline to implement more complicated methods. 

I also spent a lot of time working to build and run the 
code in the proper manner, as on Thursday we still lacked 
a cmake/qmake file which made running the code very hard. 

Mia:

This week I worked on implementing a full-run test for 
the Uniswap V2 Pool protocol. My main goal is to 
showcase the edge cases of this protocol to present and 
document its limits (slippage and divergence loss 
especially). This will be used to evaluate the precision 
of our teams’ implementation, as well as during the 
presentation of our project in January. I dealt with 
a few issues with committing and running my code as we
don’t have a build configuration yet (this is why my 
work is not on the project’s Github yet but it is 
destined to be in the Slippage branch).

Kaoutar:

This week I focused on testing the edge cases of the 
constant sum protocol. My task consisted in writing a 
test code. The objective is to view the behaviour of 
the pool on the edge cases and analysing its limits 
(slippage and divergence loss). This way, we will be 
able to showcase the limits of our team’s code 
implementation.

Minh Pham: 

- Create wallet list widget GUI displaying tokens in account wallet.
- Documenting account API.

Alessandro:

- implemented base structure for Front-End branch: 
Created class template for visual graphs, and subclasses templates for the 2 types of graphs that we are going to use. 
The classes still need to be linked to direct implementations with QSplineSeries and other Qt libraries that could be useful. 
- implemented changes in the .pro file to get necessary requirements to run this branch using qmake

Tu Nguyen:

- Completed: Add token section to the playground GUI, which enable users to create a new token with default price to be 0.
- Working on: Allow user to custom the initial price of the token.

The Nguyen:

- Added Accounts Section into Playground GUI.
- Reimplemented Token, Account, PoolInterface, and UniswapV2Pool to provide back-end to Playground.
