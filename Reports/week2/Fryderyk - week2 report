Week 2:

1. Created a structure for the a function estimating divergence loss from providing liquidity on any liquidity pool:
  - I noticed that one of the two biggest bottlenecks for implementing a new liquidity protocol is calculating divergence loss
  - That is why I decided to come up with a general divergence loss estimator to increase the speed at which we deliver new protocols
  - I came up with a estimator that can be used by the econ research team
    - One can estimate the liquidity using any probabilistic distribution
    - I consulted by choice both with the econ research and math research team and we agreed that this is a direction in which we should go
  - I will implement the function next week
2. With Adithya and Levente, I managed the entire team. I helped both the econ and the math research teams to set up new tasks
  - Econ research team: I highlighted that it is important to focus on more narrow simulators, for example: a function that simulates only divergence loss or slippage. We set up a course of action on that the econ research team considers what distributions to use for simulations while I implement my estimator.
  - Math research team: I advised the team not to spend time figuring out exact slippage and divergence loss formulae because we will solve it with estimators. The math research team takes care of the slippage estimator, while I do the divergence loss.
3. I distributed more general tasks on Trello, now individual team leaders have the role to distribute them within the team
