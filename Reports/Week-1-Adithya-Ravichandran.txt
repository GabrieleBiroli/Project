Set up the Trello workspace
Team building and distribution: together with Adithya Ravchandran and Levente Ludanyi I built appropriate team categories, collected peopleâ€™s competences and preferences, and assigned people to the teams:
Team categories: econ research, protocol research, building market simulator, building liquidity protocols
Elected team leaders
Everyone is assigned on Github
Helped structure mechanism of how classes interact such that there would be a standardized pool interface class with which every single implemented protocol would work.
Implemented modified version of Constant Sum protocol (px + y = k, where p is price, x and y are the tokens in the pool, and k is the constant) in ConstantSum.hpp
Implemented testing function to check correctness of Constant Sum protocol.
Made sure there was a clear and unconflicted structure to development for each team to avoid redundant work.
