This week I started implementing Curve Protol using the whitepapers.
Implementing this protocol will require more functions than other because
of some extented features.

Worked further on the implementation of Curve using white papers. This involved analyzing and understanding the math behind it (which was much more complicated than uniswap), as well as developing the various functions in the class. Also worked on developing tests for curve and V3.
