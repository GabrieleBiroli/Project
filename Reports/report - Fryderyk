I Collected, distributed, and explained introductory resources about the project to all team members:
  - What is a liquidity pool
  - How do we want to build our market simulator?
  - What is the role of arbitrageurs in liquidity pools?
Team building and distribution: together with Adithya Ravchandran and Levente Ludanyi I built appropriate team categories, collected peopleâ€™s competences and preferences, and assigned people to the teams:
  - Team categories: econ research, protocol research, building market simulator, building liquidity protocols
  - Elected team leaders
  - Everyone is assigned on Github
Collected initial materials for the econ and protocol research teams
  - With Adithya and Levente, I layed out the first two weeks of plans for the development teams
