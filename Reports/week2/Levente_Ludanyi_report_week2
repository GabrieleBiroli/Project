- I was working together with Adithya Ravichandran on the arbitrager algorithm, our goal is to implement an arbitrager in our market who benefits from
the inefficiencies in the market, by doing so making the market efficient
  - we implemented a first version of a cycle finding algorithm which finds the cycle in a graph of liquidty pool and a function which computes
  the optimal traded amount to maximasise the profit
  - we implemented tests as well
- I overlooked Matheo's code who also worked an the arbitrager class

- As the team leader I organised additional meetings with team members who requested and checked if everyone is contributing properly
- Assigned tasks for next week and communicated the vision for the upcoming weeks
- Our goal is to have a basic but functioning version of our project by the end of the first week of the break, I layed out the steps to achieve this
and thought trough the needed functionalities.
- Organised extra sessions for the team when we go through the existing code-base together and talk it through
- Managed the subteam leaders and discussed further progress
