Hello, I am part of the Econ Research Team. For this first week, we were tasked with understanding how liquidity protocols work and how our group can contribute to the project. I tried to read as many research papers as possible and select those that seemed useful for our project. The papers ‘Automated Market Making with Synchronized Liquidity Pools’ and ‘Impermanent Loss and Risk Profile of a Liquidity Provider’ proved to be very relevant to our project. They especially highlighted the importance of coding both risks of liquidity pools: the slippage and the impermanent loss. As a team, we concluded that our main task is to code a Monte Carlo market simulator to test the codes of the liquidity pool and help improve it. We split into two groups of two for this: one will delve into research to understand the parameters and expected outputs of the liquidity pool, while the other team will be tasked with understanding the code written by the liquidity pool team. This will be my task, with Kaoutar, and what we will be doing during Week 2 (and most probably during Week 3 as well).
