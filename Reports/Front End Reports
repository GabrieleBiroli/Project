Week 1:

Jasmine : This week I familiarized myself with the different librairies on C++, tried simulating Liquidity pools and examined the best ways to represent 
our concentration of tokens in our Liquidity pool(s) as well as the price slippage of the tokens. Next week, I will start implementing the simple interface
representing the amount and price of each token in our Liquidity pool.


Victoire: This week I mainly researched the C++ visualization tools to get more familiar with them. The accent was put on how to make graphs.
I also tried to get a deeper understanding of the project, by playing with an online simulator to get a feel of what the project is supposed to do, of what it could look like.

Next week, I intend to work together with the front end team to figure out exactly which one we are going to use and start implementing our ideas in C++.


Martina: My goal for this week was to get familiarized with Qt's tools for the front-end part of the project.
I looked for a display were users input values for our simulator to work. Furthermore, I reviewed some past projects for ideas on graphing and found useful 
libraries like qcustomplot.
I also look into graph making and other design tools.
