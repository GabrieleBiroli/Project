Fryderyk:

- I Collected, distributed, and explained introductory resources about the project to all team members:
    What is a liquidity pool
    How do we want to build our market simulator?
    What is the role of arbitrageurs in liquidity pools?
- Team building and distribution: together with Adithya Ravchandran and Levente Ludanyi I built appropriate team categories, collected people’s competences and preferences, and assigned people to the teams:
- Team categories: econ research, protocol research, building market simulator, building liquidity protocols
    Elected team leaders
    Everyone is assigned on Github
    Collected initial materials for the econ and protocol research teams
- With Adithya and Levente, I layed out the first two weeks of plans for the development teams

Levente:


Set up the GitHub repository
- Team building and distribution: together with Adithya Ravchandran and Fryderyk Sitnik I built appropriate team categories, collected people’s competences and preferences, and assigned people to the teams:
- Team categories: econ research, protocol research, building market simulator, building liquidity protocols
    Elected team leaders
    Everyone is assigned on Github
- As the project leader communicated with the team and overview the development process
- Helped those who have are not confident using GitHub to fork, create new branches and deploy
- Reviewed code and gave feedback on better implementation which aligns with my vision of the project as the project leader

Adithya:

- Set up the Trello workspace
- Team building and distribution: together with Adithya Ravchandran and Levente Ludanyi I built appropriate team categories, collected people’s competences and preferences, and assigned people to the teams:
- Team categories: econ research, protocol research, building market simulator, building liquidity protocols
    Elected team leaders
    Everyone is assigned on Github
- Helped structure mechanism of how classes interact such that there would be a standardized pool interface class with which every single implemented     protocol would work.
- Implemented modified version of Constant Sum protocol (px + y = k, where p is price, x and y are the tokens in the pool, and k is the constant) in ConstantSum.hpp
- Implemented testing function to check correctness of Constant Sum protocol.
- Made sure there was a clear and unconflicted structure to development for each team to avoid redundant work.

Jasmine: 

This week I familiarized myself with the different librairies on C++, tried simulating Liquidity pools and examined the best ways to represent 
our concentration of tokens in our Liquidity pool(s) as well as the price slippage of the tokens. Next week, I will start implementing the simple interface
representing the amount and price of each token in our Liquidity pool.


Victoire: 

This week I mainly researched the C++ visualization tools to get more familiar with them. The accent was put on how to make graphs.
I also tried to get a deeper understanding of the project, by playing with an online simulator to get a feel of what the project is supposed to do, of what it could look like. Next week, I intend to work together with the front end team to figure out exactly which one we are going to use and start implementing our ideas in C++.


Martina: 

My goal for this week was to get familiarized with Qt's tools for the front-end part of the project.
I looked for a display were users input values for our simulator to work. Furthermore, I reviewed some past projects for ideas on graphing and found useful 
libraries like qcustomplot. I will also look into graph making and other design tools.
