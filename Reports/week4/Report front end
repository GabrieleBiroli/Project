This week, we started to have a clearer idea of the front end initial result (initial interface). 
I implemented an additional window to display the graphs, which is accessible through a push button on the main window. 
I added a graph on the window to get an idea of the final product.  The graph is an example of a constant product with a point labelled.
It will then be modified and adapted to the data we get from the functions coded.

During week 5, we should have a working version of the project and I will thus work on perfecting the front end, 
by working on the graphs representing the different protocols and customizing the interface created.
